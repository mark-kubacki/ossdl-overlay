MBROLA Licenses

LICENSE FOR THE MBROLA PROGRAM

This program is being provided to "You" the licensee, by Faculte Polytechnique de Mons - Thierry Dutoit, the "Author", under the following license, which applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this license. The "Program", below, refers to any such program or work.

By obtaining, using and/or copying this Program, you agree that you have read, understood, and will comply with these terms and conditions :
Terms and conditions for the distribution of the Program

This Program may not be sold or incorporated into any product which is sold without prior permission from the Author.

When no charge is made, this Program may be copied and distributed freely, provided that this notice is copied and distributed with it. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy or distribute the program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.

If you wish to incorporate the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the Author to ask for permission.

If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this license, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this license. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this license and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this license would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the program.
Terms and conditions on the use of the Program
